# checkmate
checkmate is an HTML5 puzzle/strategy game that can be played by one or two person, on a desktop or a mobile device that has a browser app in it. When the game starts, map will build black and white stones, as well as obstacle/transform blocks on the board. Using arrow keys user can move the white stones correspondingly, while in the same time the black stones are moving in the opposite direction. 

When a black stone hit white stone, the two stones will break and gone. One can transform one kind of stone to another by moving it through a transform block. There are two transform blocks in the board, one will transform black to white, the other will transform white to black.

The game finishes either when the white stones are all gone, in which case the black stones win, or vice versa. Note that if the game is played by two persons, they should move alternatively. 

## To be finished
- Add score stats
- Add more game description and tutorial in place
- Add sound tracks
- Better animation
- and more!

The game is initially created for the 2017 [js13k game competition](http://js13kgames.com/). The compressed file size is 7,774 bytes (~8Kb). With better audio or video assets, the file size will be larger. 

## One more thing for judges (Temporarily put here)
I started too late and only have one weekend to build everything from scratch, and this is my first time writing an HTML5 game without any game engine and libraries. I could only get this far and it's one hour to the deadline... but I think this is an interesting idea and I will continue to make this better after the competition. Thanks for all the support!
